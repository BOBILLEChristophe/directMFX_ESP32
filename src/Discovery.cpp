/*
 Existence query (Krauss 3.2.5, 4.1 and 4.3), one locomotive at a time, in
 turn with the search, as the MS2 does ("search, query SID 1, search, query
 SID 2..."). A decoder that receives no query for its own address during 5
 to 10 minutes is ready to register again: without them our decoders lost
 their registration.

 A locomotive that does not answer ABSENT_MISSES times in a row is not on
 the track (one answer may be missed, or weak when the decoder has just
 started: 64 edges instead of 300 for the 241 A, 1 Nov): it gets no bind
 (if it comes back without its address it answers the search, and gets its
 bind there) and is queried again only every ABSENT_RETRY_MS, so that the
 locomotives in a box do not take the track time. Its arrival and its
 departure are written once in the log.

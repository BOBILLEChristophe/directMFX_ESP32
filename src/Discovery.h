   Discovery.h

   Automatic discovery of the mfx decoders (Krauss 3.2.3, decoder search).

   Every 2 s, while the track is powered, the command station asks
   "is there a decoder not yet registered?" (search with count 0). If one
   answers, its 32-bit UID is read bit by bit, as the Gleisbox does: for each
   bit, the search asks whether a decoder has the bits found so far followed
   by a 1; without an answer the bit is 0, and that is asked again to be
   sure. After an answer, the next question waits 150 ms.

   As a Gleisbox, the command station gives no address itself: the UID
   found is reported to the master (Rocrail as master, or an MS2: CAN
   command 0x01, response), which chooses the address and sends the bind
   (0x02), the existence query (0x03) and the reads of CVs (0x07); they are
   executed here and answered as the Gleisbox does (recorded on the CAN bus,
   31 October 2026). Each known locomotive is also queried in turn on the
   track (presence), which keeps its registration (Krauss 4.3).

   Serial command C reads the configuration of every known locomotive
   (test of the reading of CVs).

   Needs the feedback sensor (Feedback.h).

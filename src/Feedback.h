   Feedback.h

   Feedback from the decoders (1-bit feedback, Krauss "Schienenformat mfx").

   Hardware: a current sensor on one track wire (iron powder toroid, tuned
   circuit at about 53 kHz, comparator MCP6541). Its output, 0 / 3.3 V, goes
   to a GPIO of the ESP32. A decoder that answers draws a current at
   52.6 kHz: the comparator then gives a square wave of 19 µs period.

   How it works:
   - ask() hands a frame to the signal task (MfxRMT), which sends it followed
     by the feedback request and two windows of 6.4 ms at constant level
     (MfxSignal::feedbackWindows()).
   - When the chunk starts, MfxRMT calls windowsStarted(). Timers then count
     the rising edges with the PCNT, in the answer window and in the
     reference window (no answer expected: it measures the noise).
   - The first 200 µs of each window are not counted: the tuned circuit
     still rings after the last polarity change of the track (60 to 80 µs
     measured).
   - A decoder has answered when the answer window holds many edges at the
     carrier period (19 µs apart, timed by the interrupt), and many more than
     the reference window. The noise of a running motor is mostly at random
     intervals; at some speeds it gives regular intervals too, but as many
     in both windows.

   Data feedback (readCV(), Krauss 2.2.8 and 2.3.3):
   - readCV() hands a read CV frame to the signal task, which sends it
     followed by the data request and a long pause with clock pulses
     (MfxSignal::dataWindow(): 49 ms for 2 bytes).
   - During the pause, an interrupt stores the time of each rising edge of
     the comparator (cycle counter of the CPU).
   - MfxDemod then finds the phase changes of the carrier, the bits, the
     bytes, and checks the checksum.
